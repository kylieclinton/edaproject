Kylie, these are all great topics.  I am partial to the first one because I see it as being something dog lovers would be interested in as some sort of an app to compare breeds across geographical regions.  #2  is really intriguing and space lovers would find it really interesting too.  All three of these topics would have great results for your EDA. -Rebekah Webb
Hey Kylie, I think all of those topics are great! They all seem completely original, have a wide scope, and would be well-suited for visualization. I can't wait to see which topic you choose! - Justin Ross
Kylie, even if you've already chosen a topic, I figure a little extra feedback wouldn't hurt. I like the second one the most because it seems like the most impactful and practical. I'm not an expert on that field either but I imagine there would be quite a bit of data out there to work with as well. - Davis Dowdle

After looking at the feedback and what data I could initially find from API's and other sources, I decided to go with the Marvel topic because it had the most data available on the API and didn't require any extra web scraping. I also found this topic to be very interesting.
