Kylie, these are all great topics.  I am partial to the first one because I see it as being something dog lovers would be interested in as some sort of an app to compare breeds across geographical regions.  #2  is really intriguing and space lovers would find it really interesting too.  All three of these topics would have great results for your EDA. -Rebekah Webb
Hey Kylie, I think all of those topics are great! They all seem completely original, have a wide scope, and would be well-suited for visualization. I can't wait to see which topic you choose! - Justin Ross
Kylie, even if you've already chosen a topic, I figure a little extra feedback wouldn't hurt. I like the second one the most because it seems like the most impactful and practical. I'm not an expert on that field either but I imagine there would be quite a bit of data out there to work with as well. - Davis Dowdle

After looking at the feedback and what data I could initially find from API's and other sources, I decided to go with the Marvel topic because it had the most data available on the API and didn't require any extra web scraping. I also found this topic to be very interesting.

Graphics feedback:
make my graphs show increase in mentions over time
increase line width on the line plots
make sure colors are standard across all plots
make sure they show trends that will help answer questions

•    Maybe move the MARVEL picture to the beginning? It seems slightly out of place after your first paragraph.
•    Maybe consider showing some screenshots of your code when you describe it. It is slightly hard to follow exactly what you are saying. 
•    Great job overall!

·      I would love to hear more about why you picked MARVEL as your topic. You mentioned you enjoyed the “universe” but was there a particular movie or hero that inspired you? Did you enjoy action movies in general? Do you like to watch it with your family? Something that helps the reader tap in to your passion and excitement.
·      Tier 1 requires that 4-5 questions are asked. You might want to just throw in some new ones in the blog (even though this is more of an EDA blog requirement)
·      When you get into how you made the dataset, a code snippet would be helpful within the blog to better understand the process of how you created it. In addition, including something about how the data looks would give great supplement to your description of the columns. You could include a pd.head() output for what the dataframe looks like at surface level, or list in a bullet point fashion the columns of interest, or list a link to a spreadsheet (which I find easier to read than a csv file).
·      You could include a fun link at the conclusion of the blog, saying “to see how I analyzed my data, click here.” Fun clickbait stuff.

•    The one table you made about the older superheroes was confusing and I wasn’t sure what you were trying to show. The id column was also out of order, adding to the confusion. 
•    I would say that a lot of text didn’t seem to describe the graphs in the graph section. But I know that you talk about how it leads to more questions and such, so talk that how you will.
·      This is a super minor little thing but maybe move “Before getting into my insights from my EDA, here is a link to my GitHub repository with the data and. ipynb file with the code I wrote.” In the introduction.
·      You could consider changing some of your x and y labels, such that they are capitalized and have underscores removed.
·      A few typos were found, like “19623”
·      A fun idea is that with the “spider-man mentions” line chart you can throw in some x-intercept lines that indicate key events. Such as “introduced in 1963” or  “Toby Maguire spiderman released.” Really just an idea
·      I love the Top Insights summary!

I liked your topic! I thought it was fun and engaging. As far as some feedback, I would add some more technical detail about what tools or libraries you used for the EDA. I think it currently is good for poeple who don't have a technical background, but for those who do have a technical background, it could be good for them to see more of the process in how got the answers you did.

Streamlit:
•    There are so many superheroes that it is difficult to find any that I would be interested in Is there any way that you could make a subset of more popular characters that people could choose from instead of giving them all of the heroes? 
•    Maybe make the year selection a slider instead of a drop-down or typing box?
•    And the same thing as the first graph, so many superheroes to choose from it is hard to find the ones I know/want to look at.
·      With the first graph, I’d suggest changing the x-axis. I understand you have a key to decipher what is going on, but I’d changing the year labels themselves. You could do something like this https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61861739/plotly-how-to-set-custom-xticks
·      I like the summary stat explanations at the bottom of the first graph!
·      Maybe consider giving suggestions on what to look up for viewers? Sometimes when people have a dashboard they don’t know where to start or what to look for that is interesting. Give them a couple ideas to start with on the last two graphs and help them find some of their own interesting insights!
·      Some additional captions or explanations for the other graphics would be nice to make it more visually presentable.
·      Very usable and simple! Just some of your extra expert direction would make it great!
